"# Rock-Paper-Sicssors" 
This is a game of Rock, Paper and Sicssors.
When player and computer ties, a message 'its a tie, try again' pops up and you will be asked you input a valid letter from the options [R, P, S].
If anyone wins then the game ends.
If you input a letter, number or whatever isnt in the list [R, P, S] then an error will pop up 'invalid input, pick from the options [R, P, S]'
Thank you!
